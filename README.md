Frontend engineer test for VIU Ventures AG
Hi!
This is a test for our new Senior Frontend engineer position.
Requirements
Create a VueJS application that will present dog images that get fetched from the api.
• App should be written in VueJS, using Typescript. For stylesheets, please use SCSS
• Fetch the breeds from https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all
• Implement a grid, showing the breeds. Every breed tile should have a random image from
that breed as a thumbnail - fetch it from https://dog.ceo/api/breed/${breed}/images/random
• On click on a category, show a grid of images from that breed by using
https://dog.ceo/api/breed/${breed}/images
• Hovering	over	the	image,	show	the	image	name
• Clicking on an image should show a popup showing the full-size image.
• Implement pagination for the grids - up to 5, 10 or 15 items per page. Each option
should be available for a user to choose
• Use animations throughout the app
• We consider design affinity a must for our frontend engineers. Therefore, design is
free for you to choose and implement.
o Consider the current style used on https://shopviu.com
o Our customers are mostly mobile - so it’s important that the app works and
looks good on mobile
o Font used on shopviu.com is a licensed one. We cannot give you the
permission to use it, but we ask you to find a font that looks the closest to
ours.
Good luck!
